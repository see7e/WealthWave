Web Development project with HTML, CSS and JS structure, based in lessons taken in Udemy webcourse, [here](udemy.com/course/web-completo/).

The project was developed taking into account the multi-activities developed
in Udemy's "Complete Web Development 2022 - 20 courses + 20 projects" course.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the developers [Jorge Sant Ana](https://www.udemy.com/user/jorgetadeusantanasilva/)
